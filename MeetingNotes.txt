1. I removed the MNIST because I wanted to work on the 2D dataset instead, since I can visualize
decision boundaries, entropy and confidence values and see how my model actually works.

2. Trying to eigen decompose the GGN for the classification model was not possible (ill-conditioned, 
too many repeated eigenvalues)

3. What would be out of distribution data for the Gaussian blob dataset?

4. My model is confident on the egdes, shouldnt it not be confident?
