1. Play with null mask threshold  #DONE
2. Optimize the MSE sigma factor for the HEssian alculation: H = (1 / sigma) * I   #DONE
3. Steal the metrics from this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14806  (dont use the library, steal code instead)
4. Try to do it on MNIST now an d use the above metrics for comparison





3. The MNIST model is just way too big (NN has over 10k params) which means its impossible to calculate the GGN or the inverse of it,
so my code crashes there (memory allocation or just takes infintely long to inverse the matrix if i use a smaller model).
