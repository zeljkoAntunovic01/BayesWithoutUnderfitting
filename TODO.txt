Task 2:
[X] 1. Play with null mask threshold 
[X] 2. Optimize the MSE sigma factor for the HEssian alculation: H = (1 / sigma) * I 
[] 3. Steal the metrics from this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14806  (dont use the library, steal code instead)
[] 4. Try to do it on MNIST now an d use the above metrics for comparison #Started

Task 3:
[] 1. Change the Hessian for the classification (read up on it, it will be idenitity + outer product predicted class probabilities (p @ p.T))
[X] 2. Implement metrics on the Sine curve first (non classification ones)
[] 3. Switch to alternating projections for Sine first and then others
[] 4. 2D dataset to visualize the decision boundary
